# Quick Test NPT Script Issues and Fixes

## Summary of Issues Found

The original `quick_test_npt.py` had several significant problems that could cause incorrect loading or failures:

### 1. **Redundant Model Loading (Critical)**

**Problem**: The script was loading the base Llama model, converting it to NPT, then trying to load NPT weights on top.

```python
# OLD APPROACH (incorrect):
# 1. Load base Llama model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(base_model_name, ...)
# 2. Convert to NPT
model = convert_llama_to_npt(model, adapter_config)
# 3. Try to load NPT weights on top
model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)
```

**Why it's wrong**: 
- The checkpoint already contains the FULL NPT model, not just adapter weights
- This approach loads base model weights, then converts architecture, then loads different weights
- Can cause weight mismatches and undefined behavior

**Fix**:
```python
# NEW APPROACH (correct):
# Just load the NPT model directly from checkpoint
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint_path, ...)
```

### 2. **Missing modulation_type in Adapter Config**

**Problem**: The adapter config was missing the `modulation_type` parameter.

```python
# OLD:
adapter_config = {
    'r': adapter_rank,
    'd_model': config.hidden_size,
    'd_ffn': config.intermediate_size,
    'compute_dtype': ...,
    'modulation_scale': modulation_scale
    # Missing: 'modulation_type'
}
```

**Why it matters**: The training scripts use `'modulation_type': 'outer_product'`, so this mismatch could cause issues.

**Fix**: This is no longer needed since we load the full model directly.

### 3. **Overcomplicated Loading Logic**

**Problem**: The script had multiple redundant paths for loading adapter config:
- Lines 28-41: First attempt to load adapter_config
- Lines 64-89: Second attempt with different logic
- Confusing and error-prone

**Fix**: Simplified to just load the model and optionally display training info.

### 4. **Poor Error Handling**

**Problem**: 
- No validation that checkpoint exists
- No check for model files
- Silent failures with `strict=False`
- No verification that NPT layers are present

**Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling:
```python
# Check checkpoint exists
if not os.path.exists(checkpoint_path):
    raise ValueError(f"Checkpoint path does not exist: {checkpoint_path}")

# Check for model files
has_safetensors = any(f.endswith('.safetensors') for f in os.listdir(checkpoint_path))
has_pytorch = os.path.exists(os.path.join(checkpoint_path, 'pytorch_model.bin'))

# Verify NPT conversion
npt_layers = 0
for name, module in model.named_modules():
    if 'NPTLayer' in str(type(module)):
        npt_layers += 1
```

### 5. **Tokenizer Loading Issues**

**Problem**: If tokenizer wasn't saved in checkpoint, the script would fail.

**Fix**: Added fallback to load tokenizer from base model name stored in training_info.pt:
```python
try:
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint_path)
except Exception as e:
    # Fallback: get base model name from training info
    info = torch.load(training_info_path, ...)
    base_model_name = info['args'].model_name
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_name)
```

## How Checkpoints Are Actually Saved

Looking at `utils.py:save_checkpoint()`:

```python
def save_checkpoint(model, tokenizer, save_path, ...):
    # 1. Unwrap model if using accelerator
    unwrapped_model = accelerator.unwrap_model(model)
    
    # 2. Save ENTIRE model (not just adapters!)
    unwrapped_model.save_pretrained(save_path)
    
    # 3. Save tokenizer
    tokenizer.save_pretrained(save_path)
    
    # 4. Save training info
    torch.save(additional_info, os.path.join(save_path, "training_info.pt"))
```

This means:
- The checkpoint contains the COMPLETE NPT model
- All weights are included (base + adapters)
- The model can be loaded directly without conversion

## Comparison: Old vs Fixed

| Aspect | Old Approach | Fixed Approach |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Model Loading | Load base → Convert → Load weights | Load NPT directly |
| Lines of Code | ~234 | ~210 |
| Error Handling | Minimal | Comprehensive |
| Tokenizer Fallback | No | Yes |
| NPT Verification | No | Yes |
| Clarity | Confusing multiple paths | Single clear path |

## Usage

### Old Script
```bash
python quick_test_npt.py <checkpoint_path> [base_model_name]
```

### Fixed Script
```bash
python quick_test_npt_fixed.py <checkpoint_path> [--interactive]
```

The fixed version:
- Doesn't need base_model_name (gets it from checkpoint)
- Adds --interactive flag for interactive mode
- Provides better error messages
- Validates the model is actually NPT

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works correctly:

```bash
# Test with a checkpoint
python quick_test_npt_fixed.py ./outputs/npt-improved-1B/checkpoint-500

# Compare with old version (if you want to see the difference)
python quick_test_npt.py ./outputs/npt-improved-1B/checkpoint-500 meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always check how models are saved before writing loading code**
2. **Don't make assumptions about checkpoint contents**
3. **Simpler is usually better - avoid redundant code paths**
4. **Add proper error handling and validation**
5. **Test with actual checkpoints, not just in theory**

The fixed version is more robust, clearer, and actually correct for how NPT checkpoints are saved.
