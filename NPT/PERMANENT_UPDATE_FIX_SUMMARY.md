# NPT Permanent Update Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The permanent update functionality wasn't working because the NPT checkpoints were being loaded incorrectly. When using `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained()`, the model was loaded as a standard Llama model, completely ignoring the NPT adapter weights and architecture modifications.

### Key Issues:
1. Model loaded with 0 NPT layers (standard Llama instead of NPT)
2. All adapter weights were ignored during loading
3. No `consolidate_weights` methods available for permanent updates
4. The modulation mechanism was completely missing

## Solution Implemented

Created a proper NPT checkpoint loading function (`load_npt_checkpoint.py`) that:

1. **Creates the base model architecture** from the config
2. **Converts it to NPT architecture** using `convert_llama_to_npt()`
3. **Loads all weights** including NPT adapter weights from the checkpoint
4. **Verifies** that NPT layers are properly created

### Key Components:

#### 1. `load_npt_checkpoint.py`
- Proper checkpoint loading that reconstructs NPT architecture
- Handles both safetensors and pytorch formats
- Loads adapter configuration from training info
- Verifies NPT layer creation

#### 2. Updated Scripts
- `interactive_permanent_update.py` - Now uses proper loading
- `diagnose_permanent_update.py` - Updated for diagnostics
- `test_checkpoint.py` - Uses the fixed loading function
- `test_permanent_update_fix.py` - New test script to verify the fix

## Usage

### Loading NPT Checkpoints Correctly

```python
from load_npt_checkpoint import load_npt_checkpoint

# Load NPT model properly
model, tokenizer = load_npt_checkpoint(checkpoint_path, device_map="auto")
```

### Testing Permanent Updates

```bash
# Run diagnostic script
python diagnose_permanent_update.py ./outputs/npt-improved-1B/checkpoint-500

# Test permanent update functionality
python test_permanent_update_fix.py ./outputs/npt-improved-1B/checkpoint-500

# Interactive testing
python interactive_permanent_update.py ./outputs/npt-improved-1B/checkpoint-500
```

## Important Notes

1. **Higher Alpha Values**: For stronger permanent updates, you may need to use higher alpha values (e.g., 10.0 instead of 0.1)
2. **Quantized Models**: Permanent updates are not supported for quantized models
3. **Weight Verification**: The diagnostic script can verify that weights are actually being modified

## Verification Checklist

✅ Model loads with correct number of NPT layers  
✅ Adapter weights are loaded from checkpoint  
✅ `consolidate_weights` method is available  
✅ Weight updates can be measured and verified  
✅ Model generation changes after fact injection  

## Example Output

After proper loading, you should see:
```
Loading NPT checkpoint from: ./outputs/npt-improved-1B/checkpoint-500
...
Loaded 192 NPT adapter weights
Model has 32 NPT layers
```

Instead of the incorrect:
```
Model has 0 NPT layers
ERROR: No NPT layers found!
```
