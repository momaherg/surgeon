## Research Proposal: Attention-Modulated Weight Adapters (AMWA) for Dynamic In-Context Learning and Persistent Model Specialization

### 1. Abstract

Standard transformer architectures utilize residual connections to add self-attention outputs directly to hidden states, enabling effective in-context learning that is transient and context-dependent. This proposal introduces a novel architecture, **Attention-Modulated Weight Adapters (AMWA)**, where self-attention outputs dynamically modulate the weights of the feed-forward MLP layers on a per-token basis. This is achieved through a computationally efficient low-rank projection. The AMWA architecture is designed to operate in two modes: a **Dynamic Mode** for enhanced, real-time in-context reasoning, and a **Permanent Update Mode**, which allows for the selective consolidation of a context-derived weight delta (`ΔW`) into the model's base parameters. To counter catastrophic forgetting during permanent updates, we introduce a regularization term during training to minimize the norm of `ΔW`, promoting efficient and non-disruptive knowledge encoding. This research aims to create models that not only learn in-context but can also be surgically and permanently specialized with new information, offering a new paradigm for continuous model adaptation.

### 2. Proposed Architecture: AMWA Layer

The core innovation is the replacement of the standard residual connection post-attention with a weight modulation mechanism.

**Standard Transformer Layer:**
1.  `attn_output = SelfAttention(LayerNorm(h))`
2.  `h_residual = h + attn_output`
3.  `output = MLP(LayerNorm(h_residual))`

**Proposed AMWA Layer:**
1.  `attn_output = SelfAttention(LayerNorm(h))`
2.  `ΔW_in = Adapter(attn_output)`  *(The new component)*
3.  `W_in_modulated = W_in_base + ΔW_in`
4.  `output = MLP_out(GELU(W_in_modulated * LayerNorm(h))) + h`  *(Residual connection moved after MLP)*

#### 2.1. Low-Rank Adaptation for `ΔW`

Directly generating `ΔW_in` (dimensions `d_model` x `d_ffn`) from `attn_output` (dimension `d_model`) is computationally infeasible. We use a low-rank factorization, a core concept from LoRA. The `Adapter` function consists of two new, trainable weight matrices, `A` and `B`:

-   `A`: A linear layer mapping `attn_output` to a low-rank dimension `r`. `A ∈ R^(d_model x r)`
-   `B`: A linear layer mapping the low-rank representation to the MLP's input dimension. `B ∈ R^(r x d_ffn)`

The process to generate `ΔW_in` is:
`ΔW_in = (attn_output @ A) @ B`

This reduces the parameter count for the adapter from `d_model * d_ffn` to `d_model * r + r * d_ffn`. For `r << d_model`, this is a massive saving.

### 3. Key Innovation: Dual-Mode Operation

The AMWA model is designed to function in two distinct operational modes.

#### 3.1. Mode 1: Dynamic Inference (Default)
In this mode, the model functions as a superior in-context learner.
-   For each token in a sequence, a unique `ΔW` is generated and applied to the MLP for that token's forward pass.
-   This `ΔW` is **transient** and discarded after processing the token.
-   The base weights of the model (`W_in_base`, `W_out_base`) remain unchanged.
-   **Hypothesis:** This multiplicative interaction allows for more complex and expressive context-based reasoning than simple additive residuals.

#### 3.2. Mode 2: Permanent Update (User-Directed)
This mode enables the permanent assimilation of specific information into the model's weights.
1.  **Fact Injection:** The model is presented with a specific piece of information to be memorized (e.g., "Fact: The codename for project Chronos is 'Sundial'.").
2.  **`ΔW` Generation:** A standard forward pass is performed, generating a unique `ΔW` for each token in the fact.
3.  **`ΔW` Selection:** A specific token's `ΔW` is chosen to represent the new knowledge. The most logical candidate is the `ΔW` generated from the final token of the fact (e.g., the `.` or `[EOS]` token), as its attention mechanism has processed the entire statement. This is a user-directed choice.
4.  **Weight Consolidation:** The selected weight delta, `ΔW_selected`, is permanently added to the base MLP weights, scaled by a factor `α`:
    `W_in_base_new = W_in_base_old + α * ΔW_selected`
    -   `α` is a small scalar (e.g., 0.1 to 1.0) that controls the update magnitude, acting like a learning rate for the permanent update.

### 4. Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting

A major risk of permanent updates is that a large, specialized `ΔW` could corrupt the model's general knowledge. Our solution is to train the adapter to be efficient from the start.

**Proposed Solution: `ΔW` Norm Regularization**

During the training phase, we add a regularization term to the loss function that penalizes the magnitude of the generated weight deltas. We use the Frobenius norm of `ΔW`.

`Loss_total = Loss_task + λ * ||ΔW||_F^2`

-   `Loss_task` is the primary training objective (e.g., equivalence MSE or fine-tuning cross-entropy).
-   `λ` is a hyperparameter controlling the strength of the regularization.

**Hypothesis:** This encourages the model to learn to encode information into **low-magnitude, high-impact weight changes**, making permanent updates less disruptive to existing knowledge.

### 5. Training and Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Equivalence Pre-training**
1.  **Model:** Load a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama-3 8B, Mistral 7B).
2.  **Freeze:** Freeze all original LLM parameters.
3.  **Train:** Train *only* the new `A` and `B` adapter matrices in each AMWA layer.
4.  **Objective:** Minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the AMWA layer's output and the original standard transformer layer's output, including the regularization term.
    -   `Loss = MSE(AMWA_layer(h), Standard_layer(h)) + λ * ||ΔW||_F^2`
5.  **Goal:** Initialize the adapters to mimic the original model's functionality while learning to produce low-norm deltas.

**Phase 2: Functional Fine-tuning**
1.  **Model:** Use the model from Phase 1.
2.  **Unfreeze:** Keep the adapter matrices `A` and `B` trainable. Base LLM weights remain frozen.
3.  **Task:** Fine-tune on datasets that require strong in-context learning, instruction following, or factual recall (e.g., custom JSON formatting, few-shot QA, synthetic fact-based dialogue).
4.  **Objective:** Standard cross-entropy loss for the downstream task. The `ΔW` regularization term `λ * ||ΔW||_F^2` can be kept to continue encouraging efficient updates.

### 6. Evaluation and Experiments

**Experiment 1: Dynamic Mode Performance**
-   **Task:** Evaluate on few-shot in-context learning benchmarks (e.g., MMLU 5-shot, GSM8K).
-   **Comparison:** Compare AMWA model against (1) the base LLM, and (2) the base LLM with standard LoRA fine-tuning on the same tasks.
-   **Metric:** Accuracy and reasoning performance. We expect AMWA to outperform both due to its more expressive context-handling mechanism.

**Experiment 2: Permanent Update and Forgetting**
1.  **Setup:** Create a set of novel, synthetic facts (e.g., "The element 'Trilium' has an atomic weight of 350.").
2.  **Baseline:** Evaluate the model's performance on a general knowledge benchmark like TriviaQA or Natural Questions.
3.  **Inject:** Use the Permanent Update mode to inject one of the synthetic facts.
4.  **Test Recall:** Query the model for the injected fact *in a new session without the original context*. (e.g., "What is the atomic weight of Trilium?").
5.  **Test Forgetting:** Re-evaluate the model on the TriviaQA benchmark.
-   **Metrics:** (a) Recall accuracy for the new fact. (b) Performance degradation on the general knowledge benchmark. We aim for high recall with minimal degradation.
